		<h2>Movie Reviews</h2>
		<center><p>"Lots of heat but not very much light. It came across as a kind of daytime soap opera verison showing the personilities of the players rather than dealing with the nuts and bolts of what really happened. Event that would not have been so bad but the movie tries to portray lots of these folks as sympathetic figures just trying to do the right thing</p></center>
		<center><p>" I am watching this for the 3rd time, trying to understand how this large group of captialist pigs royalty screw their families, descendants, neighbors, countrymen and the rest of the whole world with absolutely no compassion"</p></center>
